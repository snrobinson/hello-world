# hello-world
This is my first repository, containing my first program, on this site 

My name is Stephen Robinson, a recent graduate from the University of South Florida. I obtained my bachelors of science in information technology where I studied a multitude of areas within the realm of information technolgy/computer science. This is serving as my first edit (commit) to this file (5/8/17).
